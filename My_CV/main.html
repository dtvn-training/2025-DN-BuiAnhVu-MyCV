          <p>
            As a fourth-year student, I always seek to expose myself to
            interesting and beneficial knowledge, especially in new technologies
            and other fields. While my knowledge and skills are still
            developing, I have a solid foundational of
            <strong>OOP, MVC, API</strong> architecture, and web technologies.
            Additionally, I have practical experience with the
            <strong>.NET</strong> and <strong>Django</strong> framework. I have
            also studied <strong>Data Science</strong> and have skills in
            exploring and analyzing data using
            <strong>Python-supported libraries</strong>.
